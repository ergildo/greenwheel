i.e - a gearbox and engine type from GreenWheelX1(vin:15) (that is the maximum we can take <br>
from that particular GreenWheelX1(vin:15), we must use the other vehicles to fill the remaining <br>
requirements of the new vehicle) <br>
(2) A new vehicle must state where its components came from. <br>
(i.e donor vehicle name and vin number). <br>
## Example output of new car:
MediumGreenSaloon (vin:24) <br>
1.5 litre diesel engine (GreenWheelX1(vin:15)), <br>
8 speed (GreenWheelX1 (vin:15)), automatic transmission (GreenWheelX7(vin:11)), <br>
17 inch alloy wheels (GreenWheelX7(vin:11)), 3 doors(GreenWheelX5(vin:17)), in cherry red. <br>

(2) Generate the 200 new products using values from the existing products <br>
(see rules for new vehicles (1)). <br>
(3) Generate 50 GreenWheel dealerships and supply them with a mix of new and old products.<br>

(2) View all the new products <br>
(3) Select a single new product to view <br>
(4) View the dealerships and their products <br>

## Project Requirements / Rules: 
+ You are required to implement the preceding program specification, in order to do this you must: <br>
Generate data on first run of program. (not hard coded). <br> 
+  Data must be persistent while program is running.(i.e program must use the generated data). <br> All data may be (but does not have to be) saved to a .txt file to be used for subsequent runs of the program (program must then use this data). 
+ Java standard edition 7, 8 or 9 (8 recommended) only, to be used.
+ Dependencies allowed (can be, but do not have to be used): AWT / Swing. .txt file/s.
+ Dependencies NOT allowed (must not be used): No additional java libraries. No Database.
