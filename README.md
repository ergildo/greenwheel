from that particular GreenWheelX1(vin:15), we must use the other vehicles to fill the remaining
requirements of the new vehicle)
(2) A new vehicle must state where its components came from.
(i.e donor vehicle name and vin number).

(3) Select a single new product to view

##Project Requirements / Rules:
You are required to implement the preceding program specification, in order to do this you must:
Generate data on first run of program. (not hard coded). Data must be persistent while program is running.(i.e program must use the generated data). All data may be (but does not have to be) saved to a .txt file to be used for subsequent runs of the program (program must then use this data). Java standard edition 7, 8 or 9 (8 recommended) only, to be used.
Dependencies allowed (can be, but do not have to be used): AWT / Swing. .txt file/s.
Dependencies NOT allowed (must not be used): No additional java libraries. No Database.
Tip: produce enough existing products to be able to use them for parts for your 200 new products and have enough untouched existing products to send to the dealerships, i.e.- try to avoid giving a car to a dealership that you have already used for parts.
